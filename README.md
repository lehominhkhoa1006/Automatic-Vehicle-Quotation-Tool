# 🚗 Automatic Vehicle Quotation Tool  

### 📌 Project Overview  
This project was developed as the **Final Project of C Programming (CCPR224064E)** at **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education**.  
The goal is to build a **vehicle quotation tool** that helps customers estimate the total price of a Porsche car, including:  
- Car model  
- Paint color  
- Interior option  
- Warranty package  
- Discount code (if available)  

This system simulates the process of car purchasing with discounts and promotions, making it easier for customers and sales staff to calculate the total cost.
